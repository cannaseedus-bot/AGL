# AGL
Short Description (for npm listing)
AGL — Atomic Glyph Language. A symbolic execution language where one glyph can be an entire app, and AI does the typing. Unified math, DOM, API, and control glyphs compiled to JavaScript.

Long Description
AGL (Atomic Glyph Language) is an AI‑native symbolic execution language.
Glyphs represent semantic atoms — from mathematical operators to DOM elements, API calls, workflows, and even full applications.

Humans interact through visual editors and natural language.
AI generates the glyph chains.
AGL compiles them to JavaScript and executes them across Node, browser, and hybrid runtimes.

Features include:
• Unified math, DOM, API, and control glyphs
• AI‑generated glyph chains
• Phase‑based execution model
• Visual programming interface
• CLI tool and REPL
• Plugin system for custom glyphs
• Browser + Node support

AGL is symbolic code for AI, not humans.
