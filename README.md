AGL is a **symbolic execution language** designed for AI, not humans.

Glyphs represent **semantic atoms** — from mathematical operators to DOM nodes, API calls, workflows, and even full applications.  
AI generates the glyph chains. AGL executes them.

Humans interact through **visual editors**, **drag‑and‑drop flows**, and **natural language**.  
AI handles the typing, compiling, and building.

## 🚀 Features

- **AI‑Native Language** — glyphs are for machines, not humans  
- **Unified Runtime** — math, DOM, API, and control glyphs in one system  
- **Phase‑Based Execution** — traceable symbolic computation  
- **Visual Programming** — drag‑and‑drop WYSIWYG editor  
- **CLI + REPL** — for debugging and automation  
- **Plugin Architecture** — define custom glyphs and domains  
- **Browser + Node Support** — universal execution  

## 📱 Nexus Studio PWA (Manifest + Service Worker)

The PWA assets for **Nexus Studio** live at the repo root:

- `manifest.json` — install metadata, shortcuts, and share target
- `sw.js` — offline caching, background sync, and push handling

You can deploy a static bundle with the one‑click script:

```bash
./deploy-nexus.sh
```

This produces a `nexus-deployment/` folder ready for Vercel, Netlify, or GitHub Pages.

## 🧰 Classic CLI Mode (No Studio UI)

Prefer a raw terminal workflow? You can skip the Studio interface entirely and build directly from a local folder using the classic CLI (Git Bash/PowerShell) instead of the app builder UI.



## 📦 Installation

```bash
npm install agl-language
```
# 🧠 Example

```js
import { AGL } from 'agl-language';

// One glyph, full operation
const result = await AGL.execute('∫(x², 0, 10)');
console.log(result);
```

🧩 Philosophy
AGL treats software like mathematics:
compressed symbols, infinite meaning, AI‑driven execution.

One glyph can be an entire app.
AI does the typing.
AGL does the execution.

Short Description (for npm listing)
AGL — Atomic Glyph Language. A symbolic execution language where one glyph can be an entire app, and AI does the typing. Unified math, DOM, API, and control glyphs compiled to JavaScript.

Long Description
AGL (Atomic Glyph Language) is an AI‑native symbolic execution language.
Glyphs represent semantic atoms — from mathematical operators to DOM elements, API calls, workflows, and even full applications.

Humans interact through visual editors and natural language.
AI generates the glyph chains.
AGL compiles them to JavaScript and executes them across Node, browser, and hybrid runtimes.

Features include:
• Unified math, DOM, API, and control glyphs
• AI‑generated glyph chains
• Phase‑based execution model
• Visual programming interface
• CLI tool and REPL
• Plugin system for custom glyphs
• Browser + Node support

AGL is symbolic code for AI, not humans.
