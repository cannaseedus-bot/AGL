# 🎨 **AGL — Full Brand Kit**

## **1. Brand Essence**
**AGL (Atomic Glyph Language)**  
*A symbolic execution language where one glyph can be an entire app, and AI does the typing.*

**Positioning:**  
A math‑driven, AI‑native programming system that compresses entire applications into symbolic atoms.

**Tone:**  
- Mathematical  
- Minimal  
- Precise  
- Futuristic  
- Ego‑free  
- Symbolic

## **2. Logo System**

### **Primary Mark (Glyph‑Triad)**
A geometric symbol composed of:

- **Dot** → atomic unit  
- **Curve** → flow / integral  
- **Bracket** → phase / shell  

This forms a **tri‑glyph** that feels like a mathematical operator that *could* exist.

### **Wordmark**
`AGL` in uppercase  
Typeface: **Space Grotesk**, **IBM Plex Sans**, or **JetBrains Mono**

### **Logo Lockup**
```
[ TRI‑GLYPH MARK ]   AGL
Atomic Glyph Language
```

Use the tri‑glyph at 1:1 height with the wordmark.  
Subtitle sits below at 60% scale.

AGL is a **symbolic execution language** designed for AI, not humans.  
Glyphs represent **semantic atoms** — from math operators to DOM nodes to full applications.  
AI generates the glyph chains. AGL executes them.

Humans interact through **visual editors**, **drag‑and‑drop flows**, and **natural language**.  
AI handles the typing, compiling, and building.

# 📦 **npm Package Description (Short + Long)**

### **Short Description (for npm listing)**
> AGL — Atomic Glyph Language. A symbolic execution language where one glyph can be an entire app, and AI does the typing. Unified math, DOM, API, and control glyphs compiled to JavaScript.

### **Long Description**
> AGL (Atomic Glyph Language) is an AI‑native symbolic execution language.  
> Glyphs represent semantic atoms — from mathematical operators to DOM elements, API calls, workflows, and even full applications.  
> 
> Humans interact through visual editors and natural language.  
> AI generates the glyph chains.  
> AGL compiles them to JavaScript and executes them across Node, browser, and hybrid runtimes.  
> 
> Features include:  
> • Unified math, DOM, API, and control glyphs  
> • AI‑generated glyph chains  
> • Phase‑based execution model  
> • Visual programming interface  
> • CLI tool and REPL  
> • Plugin system for custom glyphs  
> • Browser + Node support  
> 
> AGL is symbolic code for AI, not humans.

# 🧱 **Logo Lockup Specification**

### **Primary Lockup**
```
[ TRI‑GLYPH MARK ]   AGL
Atomic Glyph Language
```

### **Spacing**
- Mark height = wordmark height  
- Subtitle = 60% of wordmark size  
- 24px padding around entire lockup  
- Minimum size: 120px width  

### **Color Variants**
- **Light Mode:** black mark + black wordmark  
- **Dark Mode:** cyan mark + white wordmark  
- **Monochrome:** all‑white or all‑black  

### **Usage Rules**
- Never rotate the tri‑glyph  
- Never stretch or distort  
- Keep clear space equal to half the mark’s width  
- Use cyan only for accents, not full backgrounds
