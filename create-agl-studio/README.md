A minimal Vite + React template for booting AGL Studio instantly.

## Usage

```
npm create agl-studio
```

Then:

```
cd my-app
npm install
npm run dev
```

This launches the full AGL Studio:

- glyph palette
- graph canvas
- drag-and-drop
- execution panel
- model-assisted flow generator

# 🌌 Hero graphic tagline

## Build symbolic software at the speed of thought.

Supporting micro-taglines you can rotate:

- One command. One studio. Infinite flows.
- Where glyphs become systems.
- A visual IDE for AI-native programming.
- Compose logic, don’t code it.
- Your symbolic workspace starts here.

# 🎨 Marketing-style landing page

## 🌌 Hero section

**Title:**
### Create AGL Studio

**Subtitle:**
#### Spin up a full symbolic IDE in seconds.

**Visual concept:**
A dark, minimal canvas with floating glyph nodes connected by thin neon lines — a symbolic graph forming itself. A glowing cursor hovers over a node labeled `add`, hinting at drag-and-drop creation.

**Call to action:**
```
npm create agl-studio
```

## ⚡ What is AGL Studio?

A lightweight, visual environment for building **symbolic, AI-native software**. Instead of typing syntax, you compose logic from **atomic glyphs** — tiny, modular operations that can be rearranged, visualized, and executed.

**Visual concept:**
Side-by-side comparison:
- Left: AGL source (`add(2,3)`)
- Right: A node graph with “add” feeding into “multiply”.

---

## 🧩 What you get out of the box

### 1. Visual node graph editor
Drag, drop, connect — build flows like assembling ideas.

**Visual:**
A screenshot-style mockup of the graph canvas with 3–4 nodes.

---

### 2. Glyph palette
A searchable library of built-in glyphs: math, logic, flow, IO.

**Visual:**
A sidebar with glyph tiles (`add`, `equals`, `branch`, `print`).

---

### 3. Live execution panel
Run your symbolic program instantly and inspect results.

**Visual:**
A right-side panel showing AGL source + output JSON.

---

### 4. AI-assisted flow generator
Describe a workflow in natural language — watch it become a graph.

**Visual:**
A text box with “Take input → validate → compute score → print result”. Below it, a generated graph.

---

### 5. Zero-config Vite + React setup
Fast, modern, and ready to extend.

**Visual:**
A minimal folder tree with `src/`, `vite.config.ts`, `App.tsx`.

---

## 🚀 Get started

```
npm create agl-studio
cd my-agl-app
npm install
npm run dev
```

Your symbolic IDE is live at:

## 🧠 Why symbolic programming?

AGL is built for the world where **AI writes code** and humans shape systems. Glyphs are:

- atomic
- composable
- visual
- AI-friendly
- execution-ready

AGL Studio is the interface that makes symbolic programming intuitive.

**Visual:**
A grid of glyph icons arranged like a periodic table.

---

## 🛠️ Customize everything

- Add custom glyph packs
- Build your own palettes
- Extend the editor
- Embed AGL Studio in your app
- Generate flows with your own models
- Theme the entire workspace

**Visual:**
A color palette strip + icon set + layout mockup.

# 🎨 Brand kit for create-agl-studio

This gives you a consistent identity across npm, GitHub, docs, and marketing.

---

## 🎨 Color palette

| Purpose | Color | Hex |
|--------|--------|------|
| Background | Deep Void | `#0D0D0D` |
| Primary Accent | Neon Cyan | `#00E5FF` |
| Secondary Accent | Electric Purple | `#B388FF` |
| Node Fill | Graph Slate | `#1A1A1A` |
| Node Highlight | Glyph Blue | `#2196F3` |
| Text | Soft White | `#EDEDED` |
| Borders | Carbon Grey | `#333333` |

These match the AGL-ES aesthetic: minimal, symbolic, futuristic.

---

## 🔣 Typography

- **Primary:** Inter (UI, docs, buttons)
- **Secondary:** JetBrains Mono (code, glyph names, CLI)

---

## 🧩 Iconography

Use simple geometric shapes to represent glyphs:

- `add` → plus symbol inside a circle
- `equals` → two horizontal bars
- `branch` → Y-shaped fork
- `print` → square with a small arrow

All icons should be:

- 2px stroke
- rounded corners
- monochrome (white or cyan)

---

## 🔷 Logo concept

**create-agl-studio** logo:

- A minimal square frame
- Inside: three connected nodes
- One node glowing cyan
- Text: `create-agl-studio` in Inter, weight 500

This visually communicates “generate a studio project”.

---

## 📦 Brand voice

- Clean
- Mathematical
- Ego-free
- Modular
- Symbolic
- Future-facing

Tone should feel like a tool built for creators who think in systems.
